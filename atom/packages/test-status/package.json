For example, if you have a `Rakefile` in your project root, the\ncommand `rake test` will be run or if you have a `Gruntfile` in your project\nroot then `grunt test` will be run. The priority of which command is executed is\ndetermined by the order the mappings are defined in your configuration.\n\nBy default, the [following files](./lib/test-status.coffee#L11) are mapped to\nthe commands.\n\nWhen your command is running the Hubot face in the status bar will turn orange.\nIf the command exits with 0 the Hubot face will turn green. Exiting with a\nnon-zero code will turn the Hubot face red.\n\nIf you would like to view the output of your command you can toggle the output\npanel using the default keymapping. On Mac OS X the keymap is `cmd-l` and on\nWindows the keymap is `ctrl-l`.\n\nThe following _commands_ are available for you to remap and/or run via the\ncommand palette.\n\n  * `test-status:toggle-output` - Toggles the test results output panel\n  * `test-status:run-tests` - Runs the configured test command\n\n## Configuring\n\nThe file to command mapping is completely configurable so you can add your\npreferred test runner. Just add the overriden values to your `config.cson`. You\ncan now use glob style matches in the file name.\n\n```coffeescript\n'test-status':\n  'spec/**/*_spec.rb': 'rake spec'\n  'Gruntfile.*': 'grunt spec'\n  'gulpfile': 'gulp test'\n```\n\n## Gotchyas\n\n* Atom uses `PATH` from where it was launched. Use `atom` from the console for\n  maximum sanity, as Atom from the icon pulls the PATH from whatever launchctl is\n  setup from.\n* When manually configuring file matches containing periods, the Settings view\n  for the package will appear to be broken. This is due to Atom thinking the\n  period is a keypath. You should manually edit the `config.cson` file.\n\n## Support\n\nIf you wish to support this package and help further its development, feel free\nto tip via Gittip.\n\n[![Gittip](http://img.shields.io/gittip/tombell.png)](https://www.gittip.com/tombell/)\n",
