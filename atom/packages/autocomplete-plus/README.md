![Autocomplete+](http://s14.directupload.net/images/140304/y7r7g5df.gif)

**Please note:** In the example above I have "Live completion" enabled.

## Features

* Shows autocompletion suggestions while typing
* Two modes: Live and delayed autocompletion (instant might slow down performance)
* Wordlist generation happens initially and on save (saves performance)
* Suggestions are calculated using `fuzzaldrin` (better results)

## Installation

You can install autocomplete+ using the Preferences pane.
